        <h3>First Month Flying</h3>
        <p> This map shows the amount of times I was at a certain airport in June, 2019 as a Flight Attendant for WestJet Encore.
            WestJet Encore is the airline that I work for, where we fly shorthaul flights on the Bombarider 
            Q400 - Dash 8 family at a maximum altitude of 25,000ft. We carry a maximum of 78 guests,
            with 2 flight crew and 2 cabin crew responsible for the safe journey of our guests and employees. At the company that I 
            work for, a pairing is the sequence of flights (legs) that start and end at the same base. In my case, I was based 
            out of Toronto, Ontario. This data is from my roster report for the month of June, where I had three 4-day pairings. 
            This means that I was away from my homebase for 4 days. A pairing can go from 1 day up to 6 days. Anything beyond 
            working 6 days consecutively is illegal due to the high risk of fatigue and unsafe job performance.</p> 

        <p>The airports that I visitied were all in the Eastcoast of Canada as I am based out of Toronto. Our Q400 cannot fly 
        from east to west without having to refuel and this is also highly dependent on the weight we are carrying. To operate the Westcoast 
        flights, I would need to bid for those locations. As you can see, I was at the Toronto Pearson Airport 20 times in the month of June. 
        Being based out of Toronto means that we have many turns from different Eastcoast cities. The longest flight I operated was 
        from Toronto Pearson Airport to the Greater Moncton Romeo LeBlanc International Airport, which is around 3 and half hours. </p>
